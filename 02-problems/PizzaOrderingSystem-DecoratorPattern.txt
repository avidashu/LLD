# 🍕 PROBLEM STATEMENT

### (Decorator Design Pattern)

---

## 📌 Problem Context

You are designing a **Pizza Ordering System** for an online food delivery application.

The system currently offers different **base pizzas**, and customers can customize their pizza by adding **multiple toppings**.

---

## 🎯 Functional Requirements

1. The system should support multiple **base pizzas**, such as:

   * Margherita
   * Farmhouse
   * Veg Delight

2. Each pizza has a **base cost**.

3. Customers can add **multiple toppings** to a pizza, such as:

   * Extra Cheese
   * Mushroom
   * Olives
   * Jalapeno

4. Toppings can be added in **any combination and any order**.

5. The **final cost** of the pizza should be the **sum of the base pizza cost and all added toppings**.

---

## ❌ Design Constraints (Important)

* You should **not create a separate class for every possible pizza–topping combination**.
* Adding a new topping should **NOT require modifying existing pizza or topping classes**.
* Avoid:

  * `if-else` chains
  * `switch` statements
  * Tight coupling between pizza and toppings

---

## 🧩 Non-Functional Requirements

* The design should follow **Open–Closed Principle**.
* The system should allow **easy extension** for new toppings or pizzas.
* Prefer **composition over inheritance**.
* Code should be **clean, reusable, and testable**.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do (Explicitly)

❌ `CheeseMushroomPizza`
❌ `CheeseMushroomOlivePizza`
❌ Large inheritance hierarchies
❌ Hard-coded cost logic

## 🧠 What the Interviewer Is Testing

| Skill             | What they look for                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Design Thinking   | Can you identify combinatorial explosion? |
| Pattern Knowledge | Do you recognize Decorator pattern?       |
| OOP               | Abstraction, polymorphism, composition    |
| SOLID             | Open–Closed Principle                     |
| Clean Code        | Extendable without modification           |

---

## ✅ Expected Output (Conceptual)

Example:

```java
Pizza pizza =
    new ExtraCheese(
        new Mushroom(
            new Margherita()
        )
    );

System.out.println(pizza.cost());
```

Output:

```
Base Margherita cost + Mushroom cost + Extra Cheese cost
```

---

## 🗣 Interview Clarifications (Safe to Ask)

You may ask:

* “Can toppings be added multiple times?” → **Yes**
* “Can new toppings be introduced later?” → **Yes**
* “Should pricing logic be dynamic?” → **Yes**

---

## 🎯 Final Interview Hint

> If the cost of an object needs to be extended dynamically without modifying the original class, **Decorator Pattern** is the right choice.
