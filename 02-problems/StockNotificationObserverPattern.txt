# 📚 Stock Notification Observer Pattern - Interview Problem

> **Exactly** how interviewers expect you to think — problem statement only, no solution yet ✨

---

## 📌 Problem Context

You are working on an **e-commerce platform** that sells electronic products. One of the most common user complaints is:

> “I don’t know when an out-of-stock product becomes available again.”

To improve user experience, the business wants to implement a **stock notification system**.

---

## 🎯 Functional Requirements

1. The system should track **stock availability** for a product (e.g., *iPhone*).
2. Users should be able to **subscribe** to stock updates.
3. When the product goes from **out of stock to in stock**, all subscribed users must be **notified automatically**.
4. Notifications can be sent via **multiple channels**:

   * Email
   * Mobile/SMS
   * (Future) WhatsApp / Push Notification
5. Users can **subscribe and unsubscribe at runtime**.
6. The system should support **multiple subscribers at the same time**.

---

## ❌ Constraints (Important for Interview)

* The stock service **must not** know *how* notifications are sent.
* Adding a new notification channel should **NOT require modifying existing code**.
* The solution should avoid:

  * `if-else` chains
  * `switch` statements
  * Hard-coded notification logic
* The design should be:

  * Loosely coupled
  * Easily extensible
  * Testable

---

## 🧩 Non-Functional Requirements

* Code should follow **SOLID principles**.
* The design should allow:

  * Reuse of notification logic
  * Clean separation of responsibilities
* Prefer **composition over inheritance**.

## 🧠 What the Interviewer Is Testing

| Skill             | What they observe                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Design thinking   | Can you identify changing parts?      |
| Pattern knowledge | Do you recognize Observer pattern?    |
| OOP basics        | Interfaces, abstraction, polymorphism |
| Clean code        | SRP, OCP, loose coupling              |
| Communication     | Can you explain runtime flow clearly? |

---

## 🧪 Clarifications You Can Ask (Interview-safe)

You *may* ask:

* “Should users be notified every time stock changes or only when it becomes available?”
* “Can multiple users subscribe at the same time?”
* “Should notification logic be extendable?”

(All answers are **YES**, except notification should only happen when stock becomes available.)

---

## ✅ Expected Output (Conceptual)

When stock becomes available:

```
Email sent to user1@email.com
Email sent to user2@email.com
SMS sent to user3
```

---

## 🛑 What You Should NOT Do

* Do NOT use inheritance for notification logic
* Do NOT hardcode notification types
* Do NOT tightly couple stock logic with notification logic

---

## 📍 Your Task (Don’t code yet)

1. Identify:

   * Who is the **subject / observable**
   * Who are the **observers**
2. Decide:

   * What interfaces are required
   * What methods belong where
3. Explain:

   * How runtime notification will happen
